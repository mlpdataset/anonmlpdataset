        <b>Good Annotation</b>
        <p>
        <image src="https://groot-evaluation.s3.amazonaws.com/mturk_experiments/good_image.png" width="500" height="300"></image>
        <p>This image is considered good, because each formula, diagram, and image is labelled accurately.</p>
        <image src="https://groot-evaluation.s3.amazonaws.com/mturk_experiments/good_image_6.png" width="500" height="300"></image>
        <p>This image is considered good, because each distinct diagram is captured.</p>
        <image src="https://groot-evaluation.s3.amazonaws.com/mturk_experiments/good_image_3.png" width="500" height="300"></image>
        <p>This image is considered good, because all diagrams are represented as different diagrams instead of one large diagram.</p>
        <image src="https://groot-evaluation.s3.amazonaws.com/mturk_experiments/good_image_4.png" width="500" height="300"></image>
        <p>This image is considered good, because the text of a diagram is not captured in the diagram.</p>
        </p>
        <b>Bad Annotation</b>
        <p>
        <image src="https://groot-evaluation.s3.amazonaws.com/mturk_experiments/bad_image.png" width="500" height="300"></image>
        <p>This image is considered bad, because the logos or text that does not relate to the content of the slide are captured as images.</p>
        <image src="https://groot-evaluation.s3.amazonaws.com/mturk_experiments/bad_image_1.png" width="500" height="300"></image>
        <p>This image is considered bad, because the text is represented as an image.</p>
        <image src="https://groot-evaluation.s3.amazonaws.com/mturk_experiments/bad_image_3.png" width="500" height="300"></image>
        <p>This image is considered bad, because multiple diagrams are captured as one diagram. This should instead have 3 different bounding boxes for the diagram</p>
        <image src="https://groot-evaluation.s3.amazonaws.com/mturk_experiments/bad_image_4.png" width="500" height="300"></image>
        <p>This image is considered bad, because pointer text is captured in the diagram, the diagram should be limited to just the figure without extraneous text.</p>
        <image src="https://groot-evaluation.s3.amazonaws.com/mturk_experiments/bad_image_5.png" width="500" height="300"></image>
        <p>This image is considered bad, because the wrong label is used(image) and the full diagram is not captured - only a part of the diagram is captured</p>
